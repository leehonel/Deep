// My official(self-driven) start into the java programming language.
Java is an OOP language used for dev. of apps for mobile, web and desktop.
It is platform independent meaning a program written in java can be executed in any operating system.
Java code is converted into machine code through compilation and every computer platform has its own machine code instruction set meaning machine code is platform dependent.
Instead of converting into machine code directly, java uses a two-step compilation which first converts the code into bytecode(which is platform independent and then machine code)
	This two-step compilation allows for java code to be run on all platforms as long as the computer running the program has a JVM(Java Virtual Machine) installed.
//Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is an approach to programming that breaks down a programming problem into objects that interact with each other.
Components of a JDK:
	Compiler - to compile written code into byte code.
	Archiver - to package and distribute java files.
	Documentation Generator - to generate HTML documentation from our java code.
	
	//JDK is for dev. of Java programs
	//JRE is for running of java programs
For build tools, you can use either Maven or Gradle. I am currently using gradle.
During the creation of a project, pay attention to the name you give to your Main Class

Basic Structure of a Java program //Chapter One
*********************************
A package is a grouping of related classes and interfaces.
When a package name is written at the top of a .java file, this is asking the compiler to include the file in that package. A folder named after that package will be created and all the files that are part of that package will be stored in that folder.
Naming packages helps prevent naming conflicts. Two or more files can have the same name as long as they belong to different packages

Variables and Operators//Chapter Three
***********************
Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs.
The declaration of a variable first starts by stating its data type and then the varible name.
	eg. int userName
The following are pre-defined data types in Java:
1. Byte - is used for storing intergers from -128 to 127. This is commonly used in cases where storage space is a concern or when it's clearly known that the value of the variable will not exceed the range.
2. Short - it uses 2 bytes of storage space and has a range of -32768 to 32767. 
3. Int - this is the most commonly used representation of variables because of its practicality. It has a range of -2^31 to 2^31. 
4. Long - this uses a range of 8bytes ie. -2^63 to 2^63. To initialize a long value, a suffix of L has to be added. 
5. Float - It is used to store numbers with decimal bits to them. To initialize a Float value, a suffix of F has to be added.
6. Double - it is more precise and efficient substitute to float. Unless memory space is a concern, you should always use a double instead of a float. 
7. Char - this is used to store a single unicode charecter and it uses two bytes of memory. When initializing a char value, it has to be enclosed in single quotes. 
8. Boolean - It is a special data type that is used to store only two values: true and false.

Variable names in java can only contain letters, numbers, underscore or the dollar sign. 
It is conventional and good practice to always start the first charecter of a variable name with a letter. 
//Reserved words - are words that cannot be used as variable names because they already have pre-assigned meaning in the language. 
It is conventional practice to use camel casing while naming variables in java. 
Camel casing involves capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first word. 
Varibale names are case sensitive.
Two variables of the same data type can be initialized in one statement.  
(=) is the assignment operator and it is used to assign the value on the right side of it to the variable to its left.
	Other assignment operators are (+= and -=) which are used to increment and decrement respectively the variable on the left by the value on the right.  
	(++ and --) are used to increase and decrease the variable values respectively by one. 
It is alright to assign the value of a variable to another variable. 
Basic mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %) also apply in java. 
//Type Casting is the act of converting from one data type to another. 

Arrays and Strings//Chapter Four
******************
A string is essentially a piece of text. 
To declare and initialize a string variable, you write:
	String variableName ="String text";
A string is an object of the String class which provides a number of pre-written methods that can be used when working with strings. 
//A method is a block of reusable code that performs a certain task.
Examples of methods in the String class
	1. length() - this tells the total number of charecters the string has.
	//Whenever a method is used, it is presceded by a dot and then followed by parentheses after its name.
	//eg. .lenth()
