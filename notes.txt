>Basic Syntax
*************
The different programming modes are;
        1. Interactive Mode, this is launching the python interpreter without passing a script. 
           ie. >python
In python 3 onwards, the print statement requires parenthesis, ie. print ("hello");  compared to print "hello" in python 2
        2. Script Mode, this is launching the interpreter with a script paremeter which begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. 
           ie. >python hello.py   
Py is a case sensitive language.
Identifiers in py;
	Class names start with uppercase and all other identifiers start with lower case.
	An identifier starting with a single leading underscore indicates it is private
	An identifier starting with two leading underscores indicates it is strongly private.
Py keywords on page 11
Code blocks in py are indicated with indentation. All continous lines indented with the same number of spaces form a block.
(/) is used to indicate continuation of lines. However, statements contained within brackets do not need to use line continuation.
Single, double or tripple quotes can be used to denote string literals.
(#) is used to denote comments.
(;) is used to denote the end of a line therefore allowing for use of multiple statements on a single line.
A suite is made up of multiple statements that make up a single code block, eg. an if block.
 The header line(eg if true:) begins the suite and terminates with a full colon and then below followed by one or more lines that make up the suite.
Python -h is used to print out the help documentation.

>Variable Types
***************
Variables are reserved memory locations to store values.
In py, varibale type declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.
Tuples are a sequence datatypte like lists but unlike lists which are enclosed with square brackets, tuples are enclosed with parentheses.

The py interpreter can also be used as a calculator.
